# ClassicII
Reproduction of Macintosh Classic II

This was reverse-engineered from a later-revision Classic II logic board. All components on the front side, and a handful of components on the back side, were removed, and the board was scanned.

Since my scanner isn't very precise, scale-wise, the scans were resized and aligned to match the board's measurements.

The board was severely damaged by battery and capacitor leakage, but I was able to faithfully reproduce all connections.

The inner layers are used for various ground and power planes - you can make out a surprising amount of inner detail by backlighting the board and seeing what shines through the windows left by vias, etc., so these are also reproduced fairly accurately.

The Bomarc schematics for this board were useful as a reference, but they are for the earlier revision, and they do contain some inaccuracies.
